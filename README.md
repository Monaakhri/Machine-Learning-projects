Excited to share my latest machine learning project: Cardiovascular disease (CVDs)
- Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 
million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of five CVD deaths are 
due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 
years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs.
- This dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict possible heart disease.
 About the Project:
I built a machine learning model(Logistic Regression&
DecisionTree) to help diagnose cardiovascular disease
